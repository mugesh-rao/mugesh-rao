## ⚡ About Me

I’m **Mugesh Rao**, a full-stack product engineer with strong startup instincts and deep interest in applied AI.

I focus on **building real systems**, not demos.  
If it ships, scales, and learns, I’m interested.  
If not, I refactor or delete it.

I’ve worked across healthcare AI, offline-first desktop systems, multimodal pipelines, and SaaS tooling.  
My work blends **engineering discipline with product thinking**.

**Core belief:** Code should solve a real problem, not just pass a benchmark.
