## ⚡ Who TF Am I?

I'm Mugesh — a full-stack product engineer with startup DNA, GPU brain, and caffeine bloodstream.  
I build things that matter, break things for fun, and **ship real-world tech that actually solves problems**.

I’m not here for clout.  
I’m here to ship, learn, and scale.  
From whipping up an AI-powered RAG pipeline for healthcare to bootstrapping a digital rental platform for farmers — I **code with context**.

> **💡 Motto:** If it doesn’t scale or learn, I don’t build it.

## 🧬 What I Build

🚀 **AIShiro** – Local-first, offline-friendly AI engine for clinics.  
🩺 PDF, image, and audio ingestion → Embedding → RAG → GPT → Insights  
Packaged with Rust + Tauri. Nothing leaves the hospital. Not even logs.  
I call it HIPAA-friendly badassery.

🌾 **KisanGear** – A platform for rural farmers to rent heavy machinery on-demand.  
Because agri-tech doesn’t have to look like a 2005 WordPress site.

🤖 **Astro AI (Marketing Copilot)** –  
From ad fatigue detection to post-purchase WhatsApp upsells — I automate growth loops with intelligence and charm.

## 💻 Currently Cooking

- Building multimodal LLM pipelines with Tauri, ONNX & CLIP.
- Researching memory-safe, embeddable DBs like Redb + DuckDB for desktop AI.
- Designing developer-first DX for secure offline SaaS.
- Trying not to over-engineer a side project (and failing).

---

## 🧩 I Like

- Talking to my debugger more than I talk to people.
- Turning Figma dreams into pixel-perfect React.
- Embedding images, audio, and text into Qdrant like a mad scientist.
- Turning every 404 into a feature.
