## ⚡ Who Am I?

I'm Mugesh — a full-stack product engineer with startup DNA, GPU brain, and caffeine bloodstream.  
I build things that matter, break things for fun, and **ship real-world tech that actually solves problems**.

I’m not here for clout.  
I’m here to ship, learn, and scale.  
From whipping up an AI-powered RAG pipeline for healthcare to bootstrapping a digital rental platform for farmers — I **code with context**.

> **💡 Motto:** If it doesn’t scale or learn, I don’t build it.

## 🧩 I Like

- Talking to my debugger more than I talk to people.
- Turning Figma dreams into pixel-perfect React.
- Embedding images, audio, and text into Qdrant like a mad scientist.
- Turning every 404 into a feature.
